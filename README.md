# OPAC Welcome Suppressor

Do you ever get annoyed or tired of claim welcome messages when entering and leaving OPAC claims,
especially on servers with a lot of small claims?
This client side mod gets rid of them by suppressing
any action bar messages that begin and end with "â–¡".

That's it. Nothing too fancy :)
